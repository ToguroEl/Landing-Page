Flow of Project
1- think human anatomy, build first the skelleton, make sure it's well structured, then move on to css.
2- don't forget to link the "style.css" file to html.
3- create as many divs as you think are necessary, any redundant div can be removed later on once you start working on CSS.
4- ONE thing at a time, don't jump between tasks, stick to one, ensure it's been completed to your best estimation.
